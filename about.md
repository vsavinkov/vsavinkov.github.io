## About me
Hi, my name is Viacheslav Savinkov and I'm a QA engineer from Saint-Petersburg, Russia.

This blog is mostly for myself - to remember some Linux lifehacks and keep travel memories.

If you're interested - feel free to leave a comment or contact me via [viacheslav@savinkov.me](mailto:viacheslav@savinkov.me).
